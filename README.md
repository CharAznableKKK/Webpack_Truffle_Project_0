# Webpack_Truffle_Project_0
## First Try to recurrent Joanna's code but failed.
To Joanna:
  I'm trying to recurrent your code in Assignment 3, but when I use the command 'truffle compile' in the terminal of VScode, it shows that I'm out of Internet. However, I have tried both using vpn and not using vpn.
